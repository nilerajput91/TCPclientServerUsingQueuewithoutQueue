# TCPclientServerUsingQueuewithoutQueue

in above Client and Server package developed one Tcp Chat application using Without queue


and on another package develop with queue i.e in Golang Channel 


That will run a TCP chat server at localhost:6000. You can connect to that chat server like

telnet localhost 6000
And, of course, others can connect using your IP address like

telnet YOUR-IP-HERE 6000
assuming your firewall allows it.
